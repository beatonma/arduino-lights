# Extra controls
These are available from any mode and affect all modes.

### Auto mode
Long-press the `Mode button` to toggle on/off (off by default). When enabled, the lights will automatically change (different mode, colour, or animation) every 30 seconds.

### Change animation speed
Hold down the `Mode button` while you turn the `Brightness knob`. Left = slow, Right = fast.

### Change the colour temperature
Hold down the `Option button` while you turn the `Brightness knob`. Left = redder, Right = bluer. Default is fully to the right which removes the temperature effect completely.
